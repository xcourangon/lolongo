{"name":"Lolongo","tagline":"","body":"# Lolongo\r\nLolongo is a small framework that provides a simple but efficient computational model:\r\n* A *Context* is a *Data* container.\r\n* A *Data* is uniquely identified by a *Reference* within a Context.\r\n* *Data* are not mutable and cannot be overwritten.\r\n* *Context*s are structured as a hierarchical tree of *Context*.\r\n* A *Function* is evaluated within a *Context*.\r\n* A *Function* gets its inputs in a Context and puts its results in the same *Context*.\r\n* A *Processor* manages the evaluation of a set of *Function* in some *Context*s.\r\n\r\n### Why *'Lolongo'* ?\r\n\r\nThe word *'lolongo'* stands for *'sequence'* in Swahili that is:\r\n> a set of related events, movements, or things that follow each other in a particular order.\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nLolongo is written in Java (1.5 or higher) and needs a [jsr331](http://jsr331.org/) implementation (why not [Choco](http://choco-solver.org/) ?).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[LGPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
